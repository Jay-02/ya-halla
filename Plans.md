# Current Plans
Login Screen containing a name input and a phone number input.
After Logging in, you get into a screen that asks if you want to create a card.  

We Got to add a screen group that is for configuring new user settings 
so maybe we have to add a token for a first-login?

# Future Plans
 For now you enter your number and it registers into the system along side your name. However, I am thinking of expanding it into a normal login screen for Truck Drivers and Potential Employers
